run1 - base run
run2 - changes first_filters to 16 from 64
run3 - added dropout at every down and up layer (25%)
run4 - added weight regularization to every convolutional layer
run4a - changed weight regularization to 0.001 from 0.01 and removed activation regularization
run5 - expanded first_filters to 32 from 16
run5a - expanded first_filters to 32 from 16 without wreg
run6 - changed Conv2DTranspose activation to linear (not ReLU)
run7 - changed Conv2DTranspose to UpSample2D
